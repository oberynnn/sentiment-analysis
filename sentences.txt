this is the way
the bitch from Highgarden
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
Not today.
An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice.
All men must die
I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.
It is a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born in, never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
